   👉 https://railway.app

3. **Click on "Variables" tab**

4. **Find and UPDATE these two variables:**

   **JWT_ACCESS_SECRET**
   ```
   598bb949d9929807e6df6140b2faf326c3b76bfe1ab3de4cac59c35c1f77c8c51210633f45dea166b1d9a8d00570a16c162b4f5e7620902359bc42a44f3b6587

   928b8eec5fbf9da8602a4f2160f7cff680ca6017d0283f8fda119e16a46060518b9a7ead1e75d53e7451ec3020b669900f6c1a12d57131081d7675f8c1d39487
   ```

## 🎯 After Railway Update:

### Resolve GitHub Security Alert

1. Open the GitHub email or notification
2. Click "Fix This Secret Leak"
3. Select "I have rotated this secret"
4. Confirm and close the alert

## 📝 Important Notes:

- ⚠️ All existing user sessions will be invalidated (this is GOOD and EXPECTED)
- ✅ Users will need to log in again
- ✅ The old compromised secrets are now useless
- ✅ Your application is now secure

## ❓ Why Did This Happen?

The `.env` file was accidentally committed to Git in this commit:
```
Commit: 4ebeddb - "Fix: Replace bcrypt with bcryptjs for Railway deployment"
Date: October 2nd, 2025, 11:27:50 UTC
```

## ✅ It's Fixed Now!

The `.env` file has been removed from Git, new secrets have been generated, and `.gitignore` is protecting it. This won't happen again.
